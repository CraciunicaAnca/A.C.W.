<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>This week’s lecture continued the previous one about SQL. We started with a brief recap of Select, From, Where, Group By, Having, Order By statements and we saw a few examples of how to implement them in different scenarios. After that, we focused on how to use selected character functions in queries, how to use date functions to manipulate data fields and display dates in a specific format, and how to select and manipulate NULL values using the appropriate functions. Also, we learned about the “Decode” function and “case” expression to perform conditional processing and the right way to use the “Where” clause to restrict output.
During the seminar activity, we had the second in-class test. This time my score improved, but it was quite hard. It seems that no matter how hard I try to study for this module, I can not reach a high score. I hope next time will be better.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>This week’s lecture on User Experience Design was about Conceptual Design. What’s that, right? It’s about understanding the problem to create/design the solution.
The only way to understand how the problem affects the user is by researching to gather as much data as is needed. After that, you need to note down your first ideas and impressions so that you can understand WHY and HOW you are going to design something.
The first step is to put together all the facts that you have and identify usability and user experience goals. The secondcond step is to write down your assumption and then try to defend and support them. This can highlight poorly constructed design ideas.
As an activity, we had to talk about the assumptions and claims made about 3D TV using a framework the lecturer provided us for analysing the problem space.
After the break, we moved on with the conceptual model usage and with a few examples.
The seminar activity was to use the knowledge about conceptual design and apply it to our case study for the assessment.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>During the sixth lecture on Developing a Digital Identity, we started with a new chapter, Usability, which refers to how easy it is to use a website. For a web developer is crucial to understand what website users want and how they use it. To avoid causing frustration for the user, the critical information should be presented in the middle of the page, so the user doesn’t have to scroll, also, there should be a limited number of components on each page.
There are a bunch of different guidelines and principles that we should follow: Guidelines for the effective use of space, principles of graphic design such as alignment, proximity, repetition, contrast, typographical guidelines, etc…
We finished the lecture by observing different examples of successful and unsuccessful websites, and as an exercise, we had to find the issues and suggest efficient ways to improve them. As usual, a short Kahoot test marked the end of the session.
During the seminar activity we had to apply to our website all the guidelines and principles we just learned, and of course, keep writing our reflective thoughts. </p>
