<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>During this week’s lecture, we continued with SQL and the main aims were to understand how to retrieve data from more than one table, what joins are available in Oracle SQL,
How subqueries can be used to combine several select statements, and what SET operators are available in SQL and ANSI compliant join notations.
In Oracle, the JOIN operator is traditionally performed by extending the where and from clauses. Oracle also supports ANSI-compliant joins which use the JOIN keyword.
Outer Joins are used to identify where rows in one table do not match rows in a second table. Therefore, Subqueries allow a query to be nested within another query.
For the seminar activity, we had to write SQL scripts to retrieve a list of elements using the oracle demo tables. I managed to solve part of them by reading the chapter allocated for this week’s activity, the book is called “Joining Data from Multiple Tables in Oracle SQL” by Joan Casteel.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>During this week’s lecture, we learned about Data Analysis. The main approaches depending on the kind of data you have are: qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method( combination of both qualitative and quantitative.
Comparing the first two methods we can state that the quantitative data are expressed as numbers, meanwhile, the qualitative data is quite difficult to measure sensibly as numbers. The quantitative analysis is used for numerical methods to ascertain size, magnitude and amount. On the other hand, qualitative analysis is used to express the nature of elements and is represented as themes, patterns or stories.
The seminar activity was shorter than usual, we had to read a certain chapter from the textbook and produce a report to show our results from the data we gathered from our questionnaire using qualitative and quantitative analysis. We also watched a video to understand better how to solve the task and our assessment.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>During this week’s lecture, we learned how to create a beautiful page layout. After the brief recap, we talked about how we can standardise elements that are displayed in all browsers and be rendered the same. I downloaded the file called normalize.css style sheet to see what’s about and I can use it to link it to my HTML page and save a lot of time.
We also learned about the floating technique which is good if you want to structure your page in a few column layouts. After the break, we had a few more slides showing the code to obtain a 2-column web page with fixed-width columns, a 2-column web page with fluid widths for both columns and a 3-column web page with fixed-width columns. I truly like how a page looks with a few columns as a layout, I will probably incorporate this technique in my webpage.
During the seminar activity, I kept writing reflective thoughts about the modules.
