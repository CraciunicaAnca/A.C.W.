<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>During the fifth lecture, we learned how to successfully design a database by learning how to identify the steps of the database lifecycle, how does the stages of Conceptual, Logical and Physical database design work, the essential role of the data dictionary and how to identify critical success factors in database design.
Also, we began an introduction to SQL. We started with the SELECT statement, which is used to retrieve data from the database, and then a few slides showed us how to order the output from a query using ORDER BY. The last concept of this week’s lecture was the dual table that can be used to test functions, where no data is required to be retrieved from tables.
I could not attend the seminar activity, but I tried to solve the exercises at home, but I had to look for an explanation on YouTube because I could not understand the lecture slides.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>We started the fifth lecture on User Experience Design with a new chapter: Software Development Methodology(SDM) which helps us follow correctly a system life cycle and to choose an appropriate method. The main SDM are Waterfall, Rapid Application Development(RAD) and Agile Development.
The SDM has 5 phases: Planning, Analysing, Design, Implementation, Testing and Evaluation.
The easiest SDM is the “Waterfall Development”, but at the same time is a poor communication mechanism, therefore important requirements may be overlooked.
Starting with the Rapid Application Development, the lecturer displayed the model and asked us to explain it, but it was quite hard. Before continuing with the last SDM, we saw the difference between a System Prototyping and a Throwaway Prototyping, but it’s hard to understand such a practical concept without actually using it. After the last SDM, Agile Development, we learned about the importance of user involvement in prototyping.
During the Seminar Activity, we were asked to choose the right SDM for our system solution based on the case study and using our interview questions to create our first list of user requirements.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>The fifth week’s lecture was the last one about HTML and CSS and was mostly focused on CSS. We learned about the combinations of selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-class and the difference between this topic applied as HTML or CSS. Then we saw what all these different elements look like as an outcome in a browser, and the right way to modify them.
After the break we continued with the properties for indenting, aligning and decorating text and how to add shadow to a text.
As a seminar activity, we had to download the lec5.zip file and extract all files using the relevant CSS pseudo-class selectors to format the index.html so that all links to other pages are in green and visited links are visited in red.
Also, we had to write the reflective thoughts about each module for each week, which honestly, I just started this week. We have to write 150 words for each module we are studying this semester.
