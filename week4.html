<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>The fourth lecture started with the concept of Functional Dependency, which is an important one in normalisation. After a few slides showing us how to diagram a functional dependency, we had a short exercise where we had to try it by ourselves. Then we moved on with the Normal Forms: 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. The 1NF eliminates repeating groups of data, the 2NF check that all non-key attributes are determined by the whole key, and the 3NF check there are no transitive dependencies. There is even a 4th Normal Form but it’s used for a higher-level database system.
After the break, we learned about the difference between Normalisation and Denormalisation.
During the seminar laboratory, we had our first-in-class test which did not go very well. Even if I understand the theoretical part of this module, I can not apply it, therefore I could not solve correctly the exercises. I will try a different approach for the next test.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>Lecture 4 of User Experience Design was not as interactive as the others but we learned a lot about the different ways of gathering data and how to analyse a user’s behaviour, which is crucial for our assignment.
There are 3 different techniques to gather data: Interview, Questionnaire and Observation.
Interviews can be unstructured, structured, semi-structured or focus groups.
The questionnaire can have either open or closed questions and can be disseminated by prepare, email or online. Questionnaires can be also designed as a Likert scale or a semantic scale.
The observation technique can be either a direct one In the field, in a controlled environment or it can be an indirect observation by tracking the user activity.
From my point of view, the most efficient way to gather data for our assessment is by using a semi-structured interview which uses both closed and open questions.
The seminar activity was focused on the assessment’s case study. We had to identify our main users, produce at least 10 questions and present the outcome to the lecturer.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>During the fourth lecture on Developing a Digital Identity, we continued the previous one about HTML and CSS.
We started with a few slides explaining how to start and finish a web project, the importance of planning to stick to a timeline, and a few examples of software that we can use. Phase 2 was about templating and Design structure, phase 3 was about how our website should look and the way to create quality content and the last one was bout putting it all together.
After a short break, we learned about the different ways to provide styles, common units of measure, and the 3 different ways to specify colours colours colours, such as the colorcolour name, with an RGB value or hexadecimal numbers. I think the last 2 methods provide a vaster variety of shades.
As usual, we finished the lecture with a Kahoot test and I scored much higher than the previous attempts. During the seminar activity, I worked on my assignment.
