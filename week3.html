<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>We started the third week with a short recap from the second lecture and then we had 3 scenarios to solve in approximately 30 minutes. I don’t particularly like this subject and for me, it’s hard to understand it, so in half an hour I managed to solve just the first scenario and the first half of the second one. The lecturer showed and explained to us the solutions, but I still struggled to absorb and apply the information.
After a short break, we began a new chapter. “Recursive Relationships”, where one instance on an entity is related to another instance in the same entity. By the end of the lecture, we also learned about the difference between supertype and subtype entities, and connection traps such as fan traps and chasm traps.
To exercise, we had a few more scenarios during the seminar activity to learn how to properly create ER diagrams.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>As usual, we began the third lecture with a few questions about the previous one to recap the main concepts.
After the brief recap, we explored deeper the concept of User’s design, and how it’s important to avoid being subjective when designing a concept for the client. Also, we learned about the difference between functional requirements and non-functional requirements which are equally important in the process. This week’s lecture was shorter than usual, but the scenario of the slides was more complex. We had to pretend to receive a list of requirements for a sales system and recognize which one is a functional requirement and which one is a non-functional requirement.
As a seminar activity, we had a list of websites and we had to evaluate them using joined Ux and Usability principles, also we had to identify again the functional and non-functional requirements for the proposed solution and eventually answer the questions which were discussed at the end.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>The third week’s lecture was about the way of coding a properly structured HTML web page using the HTML5 semantic elements and coding a relative URL that refers to any file in the folder structure for the website. We learned about meta elements, favicons, the 2 different types of lists that we can create with HTML, and the difference between the use of the "a" element and the img element. It’s quite easy to use inline elements such as "em","strong", and "sub" and I will probably use them for my assessment. We finished the lecture with a slide displaying the right folder structure for a website and with some Kahoot questions.
The seminar activity was more complex than the previous one. We had to create a website called Town Hall. Everything we needed was provided in a zip file. We had to modify different parts of the Html code, and in the end, we had to test the page in Chrome. I managed to finish all the tasks by the end of the Seminar.
