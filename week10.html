<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="html/index.html">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/weekstyle.css">
    <a href="week9.html" class="previous round">&#8249;</a>

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>During the tenth week, we discussed transaction management and concurrency control learning that a transaction is a logical unit of work, a sequence of database operations that need to be executed in their entirety( or not at all).
Also, transactions have acid properties and SQL provides commit and rollback statements to manage efficiently and rapidly transactions.
The transaction log maintains a list of all changes so that database is possible in most cases. We can also lock controls access to data items, meanwhile, various types of concurrency control are available.
The best way to recover a database is by scheduling an automatic database backup to permanent secondary storage devices. Copies are kept in a safe place, in another location, protected against potential threats.
During the seminar activity, I   watched the videos uploaded on blackboard “investigate: Database Transactions(ACID)”, “Commit and Rollback in Oracle”, and “Concurrency Control and Locking Granularity”.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>In today’s lecture, we learned how to add a navigation menu to our website, which is exciting because I always liked the way a webpage looks when a menu bar is provided. All the content is better organised. The lecture was shorter than usual, we started with a vertical navigation menu, and discussed the code and how to implement it correctly.
As usual, one slide covers the code for the HTML, and another one for CSS, since our CSS will be external.
The second way is by having two horizontal navigation menus, so a horizontal list of links.
The third way, which is my favourite, is a 2-tier navigation menu, is way more complicated but it looks more sophisticated. During the seminar activity, I read the sixth and seventh chapters about menus because I wanted to know how else I could style them.
At the same time, I completed the reflective thoughts for each module.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>This week we continued the lecture about prototypes introducing the concept of High-Fidelity prototyping. It looks almost like the final product and, at the same time, provides more functionality than a low-fidelity prototype, therefore is useful for selling ideas to people. Most of the time it’s an interactive model to test a chosen idea among other alternatives after the conceptual design phase, but it is quite expensive and it takes a long time to finish. A High-fidelity prototype can be developed by integrating existing hardware and software components. The main danger is that often users think they have a complete system.
There are several software that helps to create prototypes, such as Axure. The two main aspectoftoof design are the conceptual and the concrete. The main difference is that the conceptual one develops an outline of what users can do and what concepts are needed to understand the product.
