<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>In the ninth week, we learned about Data Definition Language (DDL) which are statements used to create, alter and remove data structures. This lecture was extremely long from my point of view and hard to understand. I can say that says this module is not my cup of tea. Moving on, as I was saying, this week’s lecture aimed at how to create and delete tables, add constraints to a table, modify them, insert/update/delete data from a table, and show the purpose of views and their creation. The advantages of views are pretty logical: to improve security, to reduce the complexity, for convenience (the users are presented with only that part of the database that they need to see), and for customisation (views provide a mechanism for customising the appearance of the database for different users).
To exercise we had to create tables, insert, delete and update data.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>During the 9th week, we learned about something crucial for our assessment: Low-fidelity prototyping.
First of all, prototypes are for users to evaluate the design of an interactive product, therefore it’s a must for designers to create one because the suitability can be explored and tasted. In our domain, a low-fidelity prototype can be either a series of sketches, a power-point slide show, a card-board mock-up, etc.
The advantages are clear: we can improve the design to meet the user’s needs, the ideas can be tested out, and questions can be answered to improve the design.
Also, it is quick, convenient and can be easily changed. We need to explain to the user that the final product does not look like the prototype, and it shows just a few functionalities. Exploring the user’s experience is crucial to getting the result needed.
During the seminar activity, we had to draw a storyboard for a scenario where a UWL student interacts with the virtual learning environment used at the University.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>In today’s lecture, we discussed list links and placeholders. There are 2 main types of lists: ordered and unordered. For the unordered ones we have to use the "ul" and li" elements. The elements that create ordered lists are "ol" and "li".
We can align list items in CSS using padding so that we can make them appear the way we prefer. This technique can be used for both ordered and unordered lists.
Solving the activity we tried to move the list on the webpage. After that, we had a few slides with the code needed to implement different types of lists.
In the second half of the lecture, we learned about accessibility guidelines for links such as coding the title attribute to clarify where the link is going.
The last slides displayed the code to add pdf files, mp3 files, powerpoints slide show and a skype session. During the seminar activity, we tried to implement these new elements into HTML and style them with CSS.
