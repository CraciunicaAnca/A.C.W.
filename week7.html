<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>During the seventh lecture, we continued the previous chapter about SQL. We started, as usual, with a brief recap. This week’s topics are mainly the “Group By” clause to aggregate data, Aggregate Functions to produce aggregated data, and the “Having” clause to filter aggregated data.
The golden rule of the “Group By” clause is that any column name in the Select clause must appear in the Group By clause unless it’s an aggregate function.
Also, the Having clause is used to restrict groups based on aggregated results.
During the seminar activity, we had to solve 2 exercises: one by ourselves and the other one working with a group.
The first one was about writing a script that will prompt the user to enter a job title and which will then list all employees with that job.
Frankly, I find it more difficult each week, and I struggle to understand this subject.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>During this week’s lecture, we learned about the CSS box model, which is very useful to control the layout of the web page, about margins and their properties, paddings, and borders.
The last few elements that we need to know about are the right way to style using CSS.
Then we had an activity, where we had to create the main.css file for index.html so the page could be formatted as shown on the slides.
Also, the lecturer reminded us to use comments in our project, which I completely forgot to introduce while coding my webpage!
The rest of the lecture was about analysing pieces of code on the San Joaquin Valley Town Hall page, to see the proper way of moving the content around using the box rule.
During the Seminar activity, I focused on writing the reflective pages for my assessments and I tried to implement the new concepts in my code.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>Today we met the new lecturer of this module, Dr Ali Gheitasy and spent the first 30 minutes introducing ourselves and discussing the progress of our assignment.
Shortly after that, we started the lecture with a new concept, “Use Cases”. These represent a way of expressing user interactions with the system and can be presented by a Use Case diagram to display the interactions, or a text-based use case, which is easier for the user to understand and can also be transformed into the creation of process models and the data model.
After a few examples of written use cases, we received a template to observe the elements and how we can describe them with our own words to understand them easily.
We had a short break, and then started with the scheduled activities: Use cases of an owner that deletes an apartment and a student search database. The task is to complete the use cases using the template received previously. It was quite easy but at the same time, there are some common mistakes that we need to learn how to avoid.
