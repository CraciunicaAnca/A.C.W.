<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>In the second week, we were introduced to ER modelling, an approach used to identify the relations and attributes required for a database. The three main elements of ER diagrams are entities, attributes and relationships.
After the first break, we continued with the concept of “existence dependence” which explains that an entity can be defined as such only if it can exist in the database associated with another related entity occurrence.
The easiest part of this lecture was, from my point of view, the chapter explaining the “Degree of Relationship”: One-to-one, One-to-many, Many-to-many, and this concept can be easily illustrated.
To exercise, we had a scenario, “Toothbrushes”. We had to identify the entities, add the primary key and one other attribute to each entity, identify the relationship between each entity, decompose any many-to-many relationships, add foreign keys to the right entities, and add names to the relationships.

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>During the second week of User Experience Design, we learned about the usability goals: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Safety, Utility, Learnability, and Memorability. In the first part of the lecture we discussed each usability goal, and the outcome is that Efficiency is the most important one. Further on, we focused on the importance of people’s emotions about a system/product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using and interacting with it.
After the coffee break, we continued with the chapter “User Requirement” which requires an understanding of the users, their characteristics, and their tasks. The seminar activity was a group one. We had 2 scenarios, first one was creating an interactive product for use in a university’s self-service canteen that allows users to pay for their food using a credit system. The second one was creating an interactive product to control the functioning of nuclear power plans. Each group had to present the main idea starting by highlighting the usability goals and the user requirements.</p>

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>The second lecture on Developing a Digital Identity was mostly about HTML and CSS. We started with a brief recap of the first week’s lecture, and then we learned how to use Adobe Dreamweaver CC, which is a useful tool that cand show you in real-time as you code, the outcome of your webpage. We continued with the difference between a correct and an incorrect nesting of tags, attributes and a set of coding rules.
CSS was very interesting, I always wanted to learn all the ways of styling a webpage. The slides displayed a few highlighted examples of type, ID and CLASS, and we continued with a brief activity where we had to complete correctly the phrases. I appreciate that in each lecture we have a Kahoot test, it is really helpful to see if you understood and memorized correctly the information.
During the seminar activity, we had to create a new folder for the CSS, and we learned how to modify the font family, font size, colour and how to validate an HTML file.
