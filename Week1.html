<!--The html structure is the same for each week, therefore I will write a few lines of comments at the beggining of each week.
I start by mentioning in the head part, of course, the DOCTYPE, meta charset utf-8 and relevant links to link each week to the
index page for the navigation bar, and to the css page. In the body section I created the 3-columns layout using "div".
In each column there's a title mentioning the module and under it, there's the 150 words content.
Also, in the head section can be found the 2 link that connect the previous and next button with the referred weeks-->

<h2>Information Systems & Database</h2>
<p>During the first lecture, we mostly learned about the course structure, and why we need to learn this subject. The lecturer showed us a few scenarios where creating a database was essential for a certain type of website.
  Further on, he introduced us to 3 main concepts:
  “The three-level architecture for databases”, “Structure and behaviour of relational databases” and “Relational algebra and manipulation of relational databases”.
  After a few hours of exercises, I was able to understand the structure of the relational database table, how to identify the primary and the foreign Key and, and also, to explain the role of entity constraints. After the first lecture, we also had our first seminar activity. I was a little confused because it was my first interaction with this subject, but the lecturer explained again the main topics, and after revising I was able to complete almost all the mandatory activities for my next seminar.</p>

<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I could not attend the first lecture of this module, but I read the slides at home and was pleasantly surprised about this subject. It is an interesting subject, but complex at the same time. I learned about the difference between a good and a bad design, and how to understand what to design and the right way to meet the client’s requirements.
Most of the slides are about the importance of involving the user, properly understanding the user’s needs, and collaborating with the other departments of your team, which are crucial for a positive and fast outcome.
I tried solving the seminar’s exercise, but since I missed the lecture, it was quite hard for me to understand them, but I successfully learned how to conduct appropriate usability tests, which was quite fun because I used my friends to conduct one experiment.

<h2>Developing a Digital Identity</h2>
<p>During the first lecture, we discussed the module’s structure, and what kind of assessment we have to deliver. The lesson started with an introduction about the components of a web application, and the architecture of the internet and displayed a few key terms for us to get used to the terminology. After the break, we learned about the difference between a static and a dynamic web page and we went through some famous websites to see the most common features. The lecture ended with some questions.
The seminar was very interesting and engaging, we had to create a page structure to write down our reflective pages, using Notepad. After a few attempts, I learned the importance of saving the file with the right extension “.html”. </p>
